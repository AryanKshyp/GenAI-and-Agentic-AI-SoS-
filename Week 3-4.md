# Week 3: Understanding Neural Network and Sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Welcome to Week 3-4 of our journey! This week, we'll delve into the fascinating world of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and explore how they can be used to process sequences of data, such as sentences and text.

### NEURAL NETWORKS (IMPORTANT)

Transitioning to neural networks, prioritize understanding neural network architectures, activation functions, and optimization algorithms. Knowledge of NumPy aids seamless integration with these libraries. Mastering essentials like backpropagation and gradient descent is crucial for effective model training and optimization. This foundation facilitates exploration of advanced architectures like CNNs and RNNs(_Which we'll be using in this project_) for tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing. Going through both would be great.

- [**PyTorch Docs - Implementing models using classes**](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt/modelsyt_tutorial.html)

## Optimizers

Optimizers are pivotal for training deep learning models. They adjust model parameters during training to minimize the error or loss function. Familiarize yourself with common optimizers like SGD and Adam:
